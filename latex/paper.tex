\begin{abstract}
% Context
The European Union Agency for Railways is an European authority,
tasked with the provision of a legal and technical framework
to support harmonized and safe cross-border railway operations throughout the EU.
So far, the agency relied on traditional application-centric approaches
to support the data exchange among multiple actors interacting within the railway domain.
% Need
This lead however, to isolated digital environments
that consequently added barriers to digital interoperability
while increasing the cost of maintenance and innovation.
% Task
In this work,
we show how Semantic Web technologies are leveraged
to create a semantic layer for data integration
across the base registries maintained by the agency.
We validate the usefulness of this approach
by supporting route compatibility checks,
a highly demanded use case in this domain,
which was not available over the agency's registries before.
% Object
Our contributions include
(i)~an official ontology for the railway infrastructure and authorized vehicle types, including 28 reference datasets;
(ii)~a reusable Knowledge Graph describing the European railway infrastructure;
(iii)~a cost-efficient system architecture that enables high-flexibility for use case development; and
(iv)~an open source and RDF native Web application to support route compatibility checks.
% Conclusion & Perspective
This work demonstrates how data-centric system design,
powered by Semantic Web technologies and Linked Data principles,
provides a framework to achieve data interoperability
and unlock new and innovative use cases and applications.
Based on the results obtained during this work,
ERA officially decided to make Semantic Web and Linked Data-based approaches,
the default setting for any future development of the data,
registers and specifications under the agency's remit
for data exchange mandated by the EU legal framework.
The next steps, which are already underway,
include further developing and bringing these solutions to a production-ready state.
