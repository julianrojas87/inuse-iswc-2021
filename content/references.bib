  abstract  = {While the volume of graph data available on the Web in RDF is steadily growing, SPARQL, as the standard query language for RDF still remains effectively unusable for the basic task of finding paths through the graph between selected nodes. Property Paths, as introduced in SPARQL 1.1 are unfit for this purpose, as they can only be used to test path existence. More expressive features, such as counting distinct paths between two nodes, have been shown highly intractable in the worst case, in particular in graphs with high degree of cyclicity. Still, practical use cases demand a solution for path retrieval even when the total number of paths is prohibitively large. A common approach is to ask not for all, but only for the k shortest paths. In this paper, we extend SPARQL 1.1 property paths in a manner that allows to compute and return the k shortest paths matching a property path expression between two nodes. For RDF graphs in the compact HDT format, we evaluate or algorithm for top k shortest paths showing that a relatively simple approach works (in fact, more efficiently than other, more complex algorithms in the literature) in practical use cases.},

  abstract   = {The World Wide Web has succeeded in large part because its software architecture has been designed to meet the needs of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia application. The modern Web architecture emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. In this article we introduce the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style, developed as an abstract model of the Web architecture and used to guide our redesign and definition of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifiers. We describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles. We then compare the abstract model to the currently deployed Web architecture in order to elicit mismatches between the existing protocols and the applications they are intended to support.},
